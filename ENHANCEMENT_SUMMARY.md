  - Detailed species modal with comprehensive information
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Carbon potential color coding

### 5. **Backend Stubs** ✅
- **API Validation (`api/validateData.js`):** Complete validation system:
  - `validateCoordinates()` - Check against known blue carbon zones
  - `validateCarbonStocks()` - Validate against expected ranges
  - `validateSpecies()` - Verify against species databases
  - `validateEcosystemData()` - Comprehensive validation
  - `getValidationStats()` - Dashboard statistics
  - `exportValidationResults()` - CSV export functionality

### 6. **Smart Contract Placeholder** ✅
- **CarbonCreditToken.sol:** ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard with:
  - Role-based access control (Admin, Verifier, Issuer, Retirer)
  - Carbon credit lifecycle management
  - Metadata storage with IPFS integration
  - Complete audit trail
  - Retirement functionality
  - Comprehensive event logging

### 7. **Developer Instructions** ✅
- **Comprehensive Comments:** Every file includes detailed instructions for:
  - Replacing dummy data with real FSI, MoSPI, NCCR datasets
  - Integrating with actual government APIs
  - Connecting to real biodiversity databases
  - Deploying smart contracts
  - Adding real-time monitoring

### 8. **Launch & Integration** ✅
- **Router Integration:** All components wired into existing prototype
- **Navigation:** "Data Management" added to sidebar with database icon
- **Complete Routing:**
  - `/data-management` - Main dashboard
  - `/data-management/upload` - Data upload interface
  - `/data-management/species` - Species gallery
  - `/data-management/validation` - Data validation
- **TypeScript Compliance:** All components pass type checking
- **Error-Free Code:** No compilation errors
